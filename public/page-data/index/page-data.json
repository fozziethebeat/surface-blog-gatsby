By far our favorite is a 2-year abandoned hotel like\nhouse, but can't be used as a real hotel. With choices upon choices how do we\ndecide?\n\nFirst, we look at everything we can.  The cute tiny houses had their appeals.\n Small, simple, easy to maintain.  Pretty well located to skiing and town\nactivity.  A few of them had a little extra space usable for a business, like a\ngelato shop or a tiny ramen bar. But honestly, they were a bit expensive for\nwhat they had going on.  And moving into them would risk living a life just like\nwe left behind in Tokyo, only in the mountains.  In a word, they were\nuninspiring. Our eyes hold no sparkle for those nice but generic homes.\n\nSecond, we considered some very remote pensions.  These were big, large enough\nto host 20 or more visitors.  Full with small bars, dining spaces, hang out\nspaces, lovely little bath areas.  Even better, two were at the base of ski\nslopes.  Literal minutes walk away from snow. But the biggest downside was that\nbiggest upside.  They were so far removed from anything else.  People? off in\nthe distance.  Groceries? 20 minutes drive away.  Hospital? an hour away. And\noverall love put into the buildings? A little short there.\n\nThat takes us to the best things we've seen so far.  At the top of a very lovely\nhill, yet still quite close to the rest of civilization, is a much loved\npension.  12 well kept rooms.  A cute shred space and kitchen.  An amazing ski\nslope view and forest all around.  It's cute, it has possibility, but it's at\nthe top of a giant hard to navigate hill and has some risk of structural age.\n\nContrast to that is the hotel that could not be a hotel.  While not as centrally\nlocated, off in the quiet recreational area of a town near to Hakuba, it has the\ncharm of possibility. More space than any other property.  Better built than any\nother property. More odd regulations than any other property.  But so much\npotential.  Opportunity to host friends.  Guests.  Family.  Space and\nfacilitates to make new things and to teach others how to do so as well. It's so\nexciting. It's also a ton of work. Maybe more work than just two people can\nhandle.\n\nSo which choice shall we make?
