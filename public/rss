By far our favorite is a 2-year abandoned hotel like house, but can't be used as a real hotel. With choices upon choices how do we decide?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.surface-coop.com/content/images/2020/08/put_img.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Getting Surface Started" srcset="http://blog.surface-coop.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/put_img.jpeg 600w, http://blog.surface-coop.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/put_img.jpeg 1000w, http://blog.surface-coop.com/content/images/size/w1024/2020/08/put_img.jpeg 1024w"/></figure><p>First, we look at everything we can.  The cute tiny houses had their appeals.  Small, simple, easy to maintain.  Pretty well located to skiing and town activity.  A few of them had a little extra space usable for a business, like a gelato shop or a tiny ramen bar. But honestly, they were a bit expensive for what they had going on.  And moving into them would risk living a life just like we left behind in Tokyo, only in the mountains.  In a word, they were uninspiring. Our eyes hold no sparkle for those nice but generic homes.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.surface-coop.com/content/images/2020/08/1600px-JR-Hakuba-sta.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Getting Surface Started" srcset="http://blog.surface-coop.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/1600px-JR-Hakuba-sta.jpg 600w, http://blog.surface-coop.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/1600px-JR-Hakuba-sta.jpg 1000w, http://blog.surface-coop.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/1600px-JR-Hakuba-sta.jpg 1600w"/></figure><p>Second, we considered some very remote pensions.  These were big, large enough to host 20 or more visitors.  Full with small bars, dining spaces, hang out spaces, lovely little bath areas.  Even better, two were at the base of ski slopes.  Literal minutes walk away from snow. But the biggest downside was that biggest upside.  They were so far removed from anything else.  People? off in the distance.  Groceries? 20 minutes drive away.  Hospital? an hour away. And overall love put into the buildings? A little short there.</p><p>That takes us to the best things we've seen so far.  At the top of a very lovely hill, yet still quite close to the rest of civilization, is a much loved pension.  12 well kept rooms.  A cute shred space and kitchen.  An amazing ski slope view and forest all around.  It's cute, it has possibility, but it's at the top of a giant hard to navigate hill and has some risk of structural age.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.surface-coop.com/content/images/2020/08/375699-O6EmrMPrWA.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Getting Surface Started" srcset="http://blog.surface-coop.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/375699-O6EmrMPrWA.jpg 600w, http://blog.surface-coop.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/375699-O6EmrMPrWA.jpg 1000w, http://blog.surface-coop.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/08/375699-O6EmrMPrWA.jpg 1600w, http://blog.surface-coop.com/content/images/size/w2048/2020/08/375699-O6EmrMPrWA.jpg 2048w"/></figure><p>Contrast to that is the hotel that could not be a hotel.  While not as centrally located, off in the quiet recreational area of a town near to Hakuba, it has the charm of possibility. More space than any other property.  Better built than any other property. More odd regulations than any other property.  But so much potential.  Opportunity to host friends.  Guests.  Family.  Space and facilitates to make new things and to teach others how to do so as well. It's so exciting. It's also a ton of work. Maybe more work than just two people can handle.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://blog.surface-coop.com/content/images/2020/08/0BK6BK00002871.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Getting Surface Started" srcset="http://blog.surface-coop.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/0BK6BK00002871.jpeg 600w, http://blog.surface-coop.com/content/images/size/w640/2020/08/0BK6BK00002871.jpeg 640w"/></figure><p>So which choice shall we make?
